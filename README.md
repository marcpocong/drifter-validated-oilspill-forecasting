# Drifter-Validated Oil Spill Forecasting System

Thesis workflow for transport validation, machine-readable forecast generation, public-observation validation, external-case transfer validation, and read-only support packaging using OpenDrift and PyGNOME. Legacy `prototype_2016` alone extends that story into thesis-facing `Phase 4` and `Phase 5` legacy runs.

## Plain-Language Status

- Phase 1: dedicated 2016-2022 regional production rerun is now implemented and stages a candidate baseline artifact, but canonical baseline promotion into `config/phase1_baseline_selection.yaml` remains a manual step.
- Phase 2: scientifically usable as implemented, but not scientifically frozen.
- Mindoro Phase 3: validation-focused and reportable, with `Phase 3B Observation-Based Spatial Validation Using Public Mindoro Spill Extents` carried by the March 13 -> March 14 B1 row, March 6 preserved as a legacy sparse-reference honesty case, the promotion recorded in `config/case_mindoro_retro_2023_phase3b_primary_validation_amendment.yaml` rather than by rewriting the frozen March 3 -> March 6 base case YAML, and the later `2016-2023` Mindoro-focused drifter rerun confirming the same `cmems_era5` recipe without rewriting the stored B1 provenance.
- DWH Phase 3C: validation-only external rich-data transfer case under the current case definition.
- DWH forcing rule: readiness-gated historical stack, not the Phase 1 drifter-selected baseline; current stack is HYCOM GOFS 3.1 currents + ERA5 winds + CMEMS wave/Stokes.
- Forcing-outage policy: strict/reportable lanes fail hard by default, while appendix/legacy/experimental lanes may continue in explicit degraded mode for forcing-only outages; drifter and ArcGIS/observation truth inputs remain hard requirements.
- Mindoro `phase4_oiltype_and_shoreline`: implemented as a support/context oil-type and shoreline bundle outside the main thesis phase count; thesis-facing `Phase 4` labeling is reserved for `prototype_2016` legacy runs.
- Phase 4 cross-model comparison: deferred for now; current PyGNOME branches remain transport comparators rather than matched Phase 4 fate-and-shoreline outputs.
- Repo sync, galleries, publication packaging, and dashboard layers: read-only support/explorer surfaces outside the main thesis phase count; thesis-facing `Phase 5` labeling is reserved for `prototype_2016` legacy runs.
- Trajectory gallery: read-only static technical figure layer for panel inspection, built from existing outputs only.
- Trajectory gallery panel pack: read-only polished board layer for non-technical panel review, built from the existing gallery and stored outputs only.
- Publication figure package: canonical publication-grade and defense-grade presentation layer built from existing outputs only, with Phase 3 OpenDrift-vs-PyGNOME comparison boards, Phase 4 OpenDrift-only support/context figures, an explicit deferred-comparison note figure for Phase 4, and a support-only `K` family for the preferred 2021 accepted-segment prototype comparator figures.
- Read-only local dashboard: support/explorer layer over the publication package, panel/raw galleries, final reproducibility package, and the Phase 4 cross-model audit.

## Workflow Lanes

- `prototype_2021`: preferred accepted-segment debug/demo workflow. It is frozen from the two accepted 2021 strict-gate drifter segments, uses only the official Phase 1 recipe family, stops at the transport-core bundle (`prep -> 1_2 -> benchmark -> prototype_pygnome_similarity_summary`), and is still support-only rather than final Chapter 3 evidence.
- `prototype_2016`: legacy debug/regression workflow. This lane is preserved because it records the earliest prototype stage of the study, when the ingestion-and-validation pipeline was first exercised on 2016 drifter records in the Palawan-side western Philippine context before the study widened toward the broader west-coast Palawan/Mindoro context. It is not the final Chapter 3 Phase 1 study. Its visible thesis-facing support flow now remains `Phase 1 -> Phase 2 -> Phase 3A -> Phase 4 -> Phase 5`. Methodologically, it shows that the early pipeline could carry drifter-driven transport validation through Phase 1 and Phase 2, then through a Phase 3A OpenDrift-versus-deterministic-PyGNOME comparator check using fraction skill score, before continuing into legacy Phase 4 weathering/fate work and the legacy Phase 5 figure/package story. The comparator result remains support-only: a non-zero FSS means the ensemble footprint was not completely disjoint from the deterministic PyGNOME forecast, not that PyGNOME is truth or that this lane is final proof. Prototype prep still attempts `gfs_wind.nc` on a best-effort basis, the legacy Phase 3A package now surfaces deterministic plus `p50`/`p90` OpenDrift support tracks against deterministic PyGNOME, and the legacy Phase 4 weathering path now seeds from the selected drifter-of-record start in `data/drifters/CASE_2016-*/drifters_noaa.csv` rather than from the old prototype polygon. There is no thesis-facing `Phase 3B` or `Phase 3C` in this 2016 lane.
- `mindoro_retro_2023`: main Philippine thesis lane for spill-case validation. Thesis-facing, it is presented as a separate focused Phase 1 confirmation path, then Phase 2, then Phase 3B primary validation on the March 13 -> March 14 B1 row; March 6 remains the visible B2 legacy honesty row, and the March 13 -> March 14 PyGNOME lane stays comparator-only on the same case.
- `dwh_retro_2010`: external rich-data transfer-validation lane for deterministic, ensemble, and PyGNOME comparator work. It keeps DWH observed daily masks as truth, keeps PyGNOME comparator-only, and freezes a readiness-gated HYCOM GOFS 3.1 + ERA5 + CMEMS wave/Stokes stack rather than inheriting Phase 1 drifter-selected baseline logic.
- `phase1_regional_2016_2022`: dedicated historical/regional Phase 1 scientific rerun lane for the strict drogued-only non-overlapping 72 h validation corpus and staged candidate baseline artifact.
- `phase1_mindoro_focus_pre_spill_2016_2023`: separate Mindoro-focused Phase 1 confirmation lane for the recipe story. It is confirmation-only, separate from canonical baseline governance, defaults to degraded continuation for forcing-only outages, and is the preferred experimental path when you want the startup prompt to ask about cache reuse and wait budget for the focused rerun.

## Current Launcher

The current launcher entrypoint is [start.ps1](/c:/Users/marcp/Downloads/drifter-validated-oilspill-forecasting-rc-v1.0/drifter-validated-oilspill-forecasting-rc-v1.0/start.ps1). It is driven by [config/launcher_matrix.json](/c:/Users/marcp/Downloads/drifter-validated-oilspill-forecasting-rc-v1.0/drifter-validated-oilspill-forecasting-rc-v1.0/config/launcher_matrix.json) and separates:

- scientific / reportable reruns
- sensitivity / appendix branches
- read-only packaging and audit utilities
- legacy prototype tracks

Safe first commands:

```powershell
.\start.ps1 -List -NoPause
.\start.ps1 -Help -NoPause
.\start.ps1 -Entry phase5_sync -NoPause
.\start.ps1 -Entry trajectory_gallery -NoPause
.\start.ps1 -Entry trajectory_gallery_panel -NoPause
.\start.ps1 -Entry figure_package_publication -NoPause
.\start.ps1 -Entry prototype_legacy_final_figures -NoPause
```

Intentional scientific reruns remain available, but they are no longer hidden behind a single stale "Mindoro full" option.

## Mindoro Phase 3 Promotion Rule

- The frozen Mindoro base case definition remains `config/case_mindoro_retro_2023.yaml` and still represents the original March 3 -> March 6 case.
- The promoted Phase 3B public-validation row is recorded separately in `config/case_mindoro_retro_2023_phase3b_primary_validation_amendment.yaml`.
- The canonical launcher entry for that promoted row is `mindoro_phase3b_primary_public_validation`.
- The older `mindoro_march13_14_noaa_reinit_stress_test` launcher entry is retained as a backward-compatible alias only.
- The thesis-facing title for B1 is `Phase 3B Observation-Based Spatial Validation Using Public Mindoro Spill Extents`.
- The later `phase1_mindoro_focus_pre_spill_2016_2023` drifter rerun independently confirmed the same `cmems_era5` recipe used by the stored B1 run; this is confirmation provenance only and does not replace the raw-generation history of the original March 13 -> March 14 bundle.
- Thesis-facing Mindoro sequencing is: separate focused Phase 1 confirmation -> Phase 2 -> Phase 3B primary validation.
- March 6 remains visible as a legacy honesty-only row and must not be called primary.
- The March 13 -> March 14 PyGNOME lane remains same-case supporting comparator evidence only, and the shared-imagery caveat means March 13 -> March 14 must not be described as independent day-to-day validation.

## Read-Only Dashboard

The local UI is intentionally read-only in this first version. It reads the existing figure packages, manifests, audit bundles, and synced reproducibility indexes without rerunning science.

Launch command:

```bash
docker-compose exec pipeline python -m streamlit run ui/app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501
```

Then open `http://localhost:8501`.

What it shows first:

- publication-grade recommended defense figures
- simplified phase-status summary
- Mindoro and DWH validation pages
- Mindoro support-layer oil-type and shoreline pages
- a dedicated Phase 4 cross-model status page that states the comparison is deferred
- advanced read-only access to manifests, logs, panel figures, and raw gallery figures

## Safe Phase Commands

Experimental/support reruns:

```bash
.\start.ps1 -Entry phase1_mindoro_focus_pre_spill_experiment
docker-compose exec -e WORKFLOW_MODE=phase1_mindoro_focus_pre_spill_2016_2023 -e PIPELINE_PHASE=phase1_production_rerun pipeline python -m src
docker-compose exec -T -e WORKFLOW_MODE=phase1_mindoro_focus_pre_spill_2016_2023 -e PIPELINE_PHASE=phase1_production_rerun -e INPUT_CACHE_POLICY=reuse_if_valid -e FORCING_SOURCE_BUDGET_SECONDS=120 -e FORCING_OUTAGE_POLICY=continue_degraded pipeline python -m src
```

The launcher command and the direct `docker-compose exec` form without `-T` are the interactive startup-prompt paths. The `-T` form stays non-interactive by design and now prints the resolved startup policy so you can see whether it used explicit env values or silent defaults.

## Scientific Boundaries To Keep

- Do not treat the old three-case prototype logic as the final Phase 1 study.
- Treat `2016-2022` as a pre-2023 historical calibration window by design; do not defend it by claiming 2023 drifters were absent unless that is separately verified.
- Prototype prep now pads the legacy 72 h forcing window by `+/- 3 h` so the preserved ensemble jitter does not run off the edge of the prepared currents/winds.
- Interactive `.\start.ps1 -Entry ...` runs now ask once for the forcing wait budget and, when eligible input caches already exist, whether to reuse validated local inputs or force a refresh. Direct interactive `python -m src` runs inside the container do the same once per run when you omit `-T`; non-interactive runs stay prompt-free and print the resolved startup policy at process start for promptable phases.
- The shared input-cache env is now `INPUT_CACHE_POLICY=default|reuse_if_valid|force_refresh`. Silent non-interactive defaults resolve to `reuse_if_valid`, while `PREP_FORCE_REFRESH=1` remains a backward-compatible alias when the new env is unset.
- Prep is now cache-first across workflows: if the canonical same-case drifter/forcing/ArcGIS input already exists locally and still validates for the requested window, the repo reuses it instead of re-downloading unless `INPUT_CACHE_POLICY=force_refresh` is selected.
- Forcing-only outage handling is now explicit: `FORCING_OUTAGE_POLICY=default|continue_degraded|fail_hard`. By default, scientific/reportable lanes fail hard, while appendix/legacy/experimental lanes may skip the affected forcing-dependent branch or recipe subset with manifest honesty fields and `rerun_required=true`. This does not apply to drifter truth or ArcGIS/observation truth acquisition.
- Forcing providers now also fail fast under `FORCING_SOURCE_BUDGET_SECONDS` with a default per-provider wall-clock budget of `300` seconds. Set `FORCING_SOURCE_BUDGET_SECONDS=0` only when you intentionally want the old wait-forever debugging behavior.
- Keep historical/regional transport validation separate from spill-case validation.
- Treat `Phase 3B` and `Phase 3C` as validation-only lanes.
- Keep the drifter-debug lanes separate from the support-only `phase4_oiltype_and_shoreline` workflow outside `prototype_2016`.
- Keep `prototype_2016` framed as legacy `Phase 1 / 2 / 3A / 4 / 5` support only, with no thesis-facing 3B/3C lane.
- Keep the Mindoro-focused Phase 1 rerun as a separate confirmation-only path; do not treat it as canonical baseline governance or as a rewrite of stored B1 provenance.
- For `prototype_2016`, treat the selected drifter-of-record start lat/lon/time as the authoritative release origin. Some legacy audit fields may still point at `data/arcgis/CASE_2016-*/source_point_metadata.geojson` for compatibility, but that file is not the release geometry used by the run.
- Do not auto-promote `output/phase1_production_rerun/phase1_baseline_selection_candidate.yaml` over `config/phase1_baseline_selection.yaml`.
- Do not describe DWH Phase 3C as using the Phase 1 drifter-selected baseline for forcing selection; DWH uses a readiness-gated HYCOM GOFS 3.1 + ERA5 + CMEMS wave/Stokes stack.
- Do not treat DWH observed masks as anything other than truth, and do not treat PyGNOME as anything other than comparator-only.
- Do not present DWH as the main Philippine thesis case; keep Mindoro primary and DWH separate.
- Do not relabel thresholded ensemble products: `mask_p50` and `mask_p90` semantics are unchanged.
- Do not mix Phase 4 oil-type sensitivity into Phase 2 or Phase 3 baseline products.
- Do not pretend Phase 1 or Phase 2 are fully frozen when they are not.
- Do not silently rewrite the original March 3 -> March 6 Mindoro case definition when discussing the promoted March 13 -> March 14 row.
- Do not claim independent day-to-day validation for March 13 -> March 14 while both NOAA/NESDIS public products still cite the same March 12 WorldView-3 imagery.

## Git Hygiene

The repo now keeps bulky case output trees ignored by default, while allowing lightweight audit/package artifacts to remain trackable where appropriate:

- Phase 1 audit outputs
- Phase 2 audit outputs
- Mindoro Phase 4 support summary artifacts
- final validation package summaries
- final reproducibility package summaries

Large raw data, scientific raster stacks, NetCDF outputs, and bulk case rerun artifacts remain excluded.

## Status Stamp

- Last updated: 2026-04-13
- Current sync state: support sync plus raw, polished, and publication-grade read-only figure packages added
- Biggest remaining scientific follow-up: the staged Phase 1 candidate baseline still needs deliberate downstream trial or explicit promotion before the default spill-case baseline file changes
