# Drifter-Validated Oil Spill Forecasting System

Thesis workflow for transport validation, machine-readable forecast generation, public-observation scoring, external-case transfer validation, oil-type shoreline interpretation, and final reproducibility packaging using OpenDrift and PyGNOME.

## Plain-Language Status

- Phase 1: dedicated 2016-2022 regional production rerun is now implemented and stages a candidate baseline artifact, but canonical baseline promotion into `config/phase1_baseline_selection.yaml` remains a manual step.
- Phase 2: scientifically usable as implemented, but not scientifically frozen.
- Mindoro Phase 3: scientifically informative and reportable, with March 13 -> March 14 promoted as the primary validation, March 6 preserved as a legacy sparse-reference honesty case, and the promotion recorded in `config/case_mindoro_retro_2023_phase3b_primary_validation_amendment.yaml` rather than by rewriting the frozen March 3 -> March 6 base case YAML.
- DWH Phase 3C: external rich-data transfer validation success under the current case definition.
- DWH forcing rule: readiness-gated historical stack, not the Phase 1 drifter-selected baseline; current stack is HYCOM GOFS 3.1 currents + ERA5 winds + CMEMS wave/Stokes.
- Phase 4: scientifically reportable now for Mindoro, but inherited-provisional from the upstream Phase 1/2 freeze story.
- Phase 4 cross-model comparison: deferred for now; current PyGNOME branches remain transport comparators rather than matched Phase 4 fate-and-shoreline outputs.
- Phase 5: launcher, docs, and reproducibility/package synchronization layer.
- Trajectory gallery: read-only static technical figure layer for panel inspection, built from existing outputs only.
- Trajectory gallery panel pack: read-only polished board layer for non-technical panel review, built from the existing gallery and stored outputs only.
- Publication figure package: canonical publication-grade and defense-grade presentation layer built from existing outputs only, with Phase 3 OpenDrift-vs-PyGNOME comparison boards, Phase 4 OpenDrift-only figures, an explicit deferred-comparison note figure for Phase 4, and a support-only `K` family for the preferred 2021 accepted-segment prototype comparator figures.
- Read-only local dashboard: Phase 5 explorer layer over the publication package, panel/raw galleries, final reproducibility package, and the Phase 4 cross-model audit.

## Workflow Lanes

- `prototype_2021`: preferred accepted-segment debug/demo workflow. It is frozen from the two accepted 2021 strict-gate drifter segments, uses only the official Phase 1 recipe family, stops at the transport-core bundle (`prep -> 1_2 -> benchmark -> prototype_pygnome_similarity_summary`), and is still support-only rather than final Chapter 3 evidence.
- `prototype_2016`: legacy debug/regression workflow. This is preserved intentionally, but it is not the final Chapter 3 Phase 1 study. Its visible thesis-facing support flow is `Phase 1 -> Phase 2 -> Phase 3A -> Phase 4`, with `phase5_sync` kept separate. Prototype prep still attempts `gfs_wind.nc` on a best-effort basis, the legacy Phase 3A package now surfaces deterministic plus `p50`/`p90` OpenDrift support tracks against deterministic PyGNOME, and the legacy Phase 4 weathering path now seeds from the drifter-of-record point instead of the old prototype polygon. There is no thesis-facing `Phase 3B` or `Phase 3C` in this 2016 lane.
- `mindoro_retro_2023`: main Philippine thesis lane for official forecast products, Phase 3 scoring, and Phase 4 oil-type shoreline interpretation.
- `dwh_retro_2010`: external rich-data transfer-validation lane for deterministic, ensemble, and PyGNOME comparator work. It keeps DWH observed daily masks as truth, keeps PyGNOME comparator-only, and freezes a readiness-gated HYCOM GOFS 3.1 + ERA5 + CMEMS wave/Stokes stack rather than inheriting Phase 1 drifter-selected baseline logic.
- `phase1_regional_2016_2022`: dedicated historical/regional Phase 1 scientific rerun lane for the strict drogued-only non-overlapping 72 h validation corpus and staged candidate baseline artifact.

## Current Launcher

The current launcher entrypoint is [start.ps1](/c:/Users/marcp/Downloads/drifter-validated-oilspill-forecasting-rc-v1.0/drifter-validated-oilspill-forecasting-rc-v1.0/start.ps1). It is driven by [config/launcher_matrix.json](/c:/Users/marcp/Downloads/drifter-validated-oilspill-forecasting-rc-v1.0/drifter-validated-oilspill-forecasting-rc-v1.0/config/launcher_matrix.json) and separates:

- scientific / reportable reruns
- sensitivity / appendix branches
- read-only packaging and audit utilities
- legacy prototype tracks

Safe first commands:

```powershell
.\start.ps1 -List -NoPause
.\start.ps1 -Help -NoPause
.\start.ps1 -Entry phase5_sync -NoPause
.\start.ps1 -Entry trajectory_gallery -NoPause
.\start.ps1 -Entry trajectory_gallery_panel -NoPause
.\start.ps1 -Entry figure_package_publication -NoPause
```

Intentional scientific reruns remain available, but they are no longer hidden behind a single stale "Mindoro full" option.

## Mindoro Phase 3 Promotion Rule

- The frozen Mindoro base case definition remains `config/case_mindoro_retro_2023.yaml` and still represents the original March 3 -> March 6 case.
- The promoted Phase 3B public-validation row is recorded separately in `config/case_mindoro_retro_2023_phase3b_primary_validation_amendment.yaml`.
- The canonical launcher entry for that promoted row is `mindoro_phase3b_primary_public_validation`.
- The older `mindoro_march13_14_noaa_reinit_stress_test` launcher entry is retained as a backward-compatible alias only.
- March 6 remains visible as a legacy honesty-only row and must not be called primary.
- PyGNOME remains comparator-only, and the shared-imagery caveat means March 13 -> March 14 must not be described as independent day-to-day validation.

## Read-Only Dashboard

The local UI is intentionally read-only in this first version. It reads the existing figure packages, manifests, audit bundles, and synced reproducibility indexes without rerunning science.

Launch command:

```bash
docker-compose exec pipeline python -m streamlit run ui/app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501
```

Then open `http://localhost:8501`.

What it shows first:

- publication-grade recommended defense figures
- simplified phase-status summary
- Mindoro and DWH validation pages
- Mindoro Phase 4 oil-type and shoreline pages
- a dedicated Phase 4 cross-model status page that states the comparison is deferred
- advanced read-only access to manifests, logs, panel figures, and raw gallery figures

```

## Scientific Boundaries To Keep

- Do not treat the old three-case prototype logic as the final Phase 1 study.
- Treat `2016-2022` as a pre-2023 historical calibration window by design; do not defend it by claiming 2023 drifters were absent unless that is separately verified.
- Prototype prep now pads the legacy 72 h forcing window by `+/- 3 h` so the preserved ensemble jitter does not run off the edge of the prepared currents/winds.
- Prep is now cache-first across workflows: if the canonical same-case drifter/forcing/ArcGIS input already exists locally and still validates for the requested window, the repo reuses it instead of re-downloading. Set `PREP_FORCE_REFRESH=1` when you intentionally want to refresh remote inputs.
- Keep historical/regional transport validation separate from spill-case validation.
- Keep the drifter-debug lanes separate from `Phase 4 = Oil-Type Fate and Shoreline Impact Analysis`.
- Keep `prototype_2016` framed as legacy `Phase 1 / 2 / 3A / 4` support only, with no thesis-facing 3B/3C lane.
- Do not auto-promote `output/phase1_production_rerun/phase1_baseline_selection_candidate.yaml` over `config/phase1_baseline_selection.yaml`.
- Do not describe DWH Phase 3C as using the Phase 1 drifter-selected baseline for forcing selection; DWH uses a readiness-gated HYCOM GOFS 3.1 + ERA5 + CMEMS wave/Stokes stack.
- Do not treat DWH observed masks as anything other than truth, and do not treat PyGNOME as anything other than comparator-only.
- Do not present DWH as the main Philippine thesis case; keep Mindoro primary and DWH separate.
- Do not relabel thresholded ensemble products: `mask_p50` and `mask_p90` semantics are unchanged.
- Do not mix Phase 4 oil-type sensitivity into Phase 2 or Phase 3 baseline products.
- Do not pretend Phase 1 or Phase 2 are fully frozen when they are not.
- Do not silently rewrite the original March 3 -> March 6 Mindoro case definition when discussing the promoted March 13 -> March 14 row.
- Do not claim independent day-to-day validation for March 13 -> March 14 while both NOAA/NESDIS public products still cite the same March 12 WorldView-3 imagery.

## Git Hygiene

The repo now keeps bulky case output trees ignored by default, while allowing lightweight audit/package artifacts to remain trackable where appropriate:

- Phase 1 audit outputs
- Phase 2 audit outputs
- Mindoro Phase 4 summary artifacts
- final validation package summaries
- final reproducibility package summaries

Large raw data, scientific raster stacks, NetCDF outputs, and bulk case rerun artifacts remain excluded.

## Status Stamp

- Last updated: 2026-04-12
- Current sync state: Phase 5 sync plus raw, polished, and publication-grade read-only figure packages added
- Biggest remaining scientific follow-up: the staged Phase 1 candidate baseline still needs deliberate downstream trial or explicit promotion before the default spill-case baseline file changes
