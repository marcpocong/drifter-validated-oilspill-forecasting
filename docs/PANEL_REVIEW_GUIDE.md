# Panel Review Guide

This guide is for panel members who want to inspect the stored thesis outputs, verify that the software matches the manuscript, and stay inside the final defended evidence boundaries.

The practical rule is simple: panel mode and read-only entries do not rerun science.

## 1. Start Here

Use either command:

```powershell
.\panel.ps1
.\start.ps1 -Panel
```

That opens the panel-safe launcher path instead of the full research launcher.

## 2. What The Panel Menu Safely Does

1. Open the read-only dashboard
2. Verify stored manuscript numbers against stored scorecards
3. Rebuild publication figures from stored outputs only
4. Inspect the focused Phase 1 drifter provenance behind `B1`
5. Refresh the final validation package from stored outputs only
6. Refresh the reproducibility / docs package from stored outputs only
7. Open the paper-to-output registry
8. Open the data sources and provenance registry

None of those steps are meant to rerun expensive science or change thesis claims.

## Data Sources and Provenance

Use [DATA_SOURCES.md](DATA_SOURCES.md) or the dashboard's `Data Sources & Provenance` reference page to answer what external data sources were used, where they came from, what each source was used for, and where the related manifests or stored outputs live. This is read-only governance documentation backed by [config/data_sources.yaml](../config/data_sources.yaml); it does not promote new claims or rerun science.

## 3. Final Manuscript Evidence Order

1. Focused Mindoro Phase 1 provenance
2. Phase 2 standardized forecast products
3. Mindoro `B1` primary public-observation validation
4. Mindoro `Track A` same-case OpenDrift versus PyGNOME comparator-only support
5. DWH external transfer validation
6. Mindoro oil-type and shoreline support/context
7. `prototype_2016` legacy/archive support
8. Reproducibility / governance / read-only package layer

Panel mode is built to respect that order instead of flattening the repo into one undifferentiated list.

## 4. Key Claim Boundaries

- `B1` is the only main Philippine public-observation validation claim.
- `B1` supports coastal-neighborhood usefulness, not exact 1 km overlap or universal operational accuracy.
- March 13-14 keeps the observation-independence note explicit.
- `Track A` is comparator-only support.
- PyGNOME is comparator-only and never the observational scoring reference.
- DWH is external transfer validation, not Mindoro recalibration.
- Mindoro oil-type and shoreline outputs are support/context only.
- `prototype_2016` is legacy/archive support only.
- The dashboard, publication package, validation packages, audits, and docs entries are read-only or packaging-only surfaces that do not recompute science.

## 5. Result Values Checklist

### Focused Phase 1 Provenance

- Workflow mode: `phase1_mindoro_focus_pre_spill_2016_2023`
- Historical window: `2016-01-01` to `2023-03-02`
- Focused validation box: `[118.751, 124.305, 10.620, 16.026]`
- Full strict accepted segments: `65`
- Ranked February-April subset: `19`
- Recipe winner: `cmems_gfs`
- `cmems_gfs` mean / median NCS: `4.5886 / 4.6305`
- `cmems_era5` mean / median NCS: `4.6237 / 4.5916`
- `hycom_gfs` mean / median NCS: `4.7027 / 4.9263`
- `hycom_era5` mean / median NCS: `4.7561 / 5.0106`

### Mindoro `B1`

- FSS `1 / 3 / 5 / 10 km`: `0.0000 / 0.0441 / 0.1371 / 0.2490`
- Mean FSS: `0.1075`
- `R0`: did not reach target date; forecast cells `0`; observed cells `22`
- `R1_previous`: forecast cells `5`; observed cells `22`; nearest distance `1414.21 m`; centroid distance `7358.16 m`
- `IoU = 0.0`; `Dice = 0.0`
- Interpretation: `R1_previous` is promoted because it survives and is scoreable, not because it is an exact-grid match or exact 1 km overlap

### Mindoro `Track A`

- OpenDrift `R1_previous`: forecast cells `5`; nearest distance `1414.21 m`; mean FSS `0.1075`
- OpenDrift `R0`: forecast cells `0`; mean FSS `0.0000`
- PyGNOME deterministic comparator-only support: forecast cells `6`; nearest distance `6082.76 m`; FSS `0.0000 / 0.0000 / 0.0000 / 0.0244`; mean FSS `0.0061`

### DWH

- Case ID: `CASE_DWH_RETRO_2010_72H`
- Forcing stack: `HYCOM GOFS 3.1 currents + ERA5 winds + CMEMS wave/Stokes`
- `C1` event-corridor mean FSS: `0.5568`
- `C2 p50` event-corridor mean FSS: `0.5389`
- `C2 p90` event-corridor mean FSS: `0.4966`
- `C3` PyGNOME comparator event-corridor mean FSS: `0.3612`
- Interpretation: DWH remains an external transfer validation story and does not recalibrate Mindoro

### Mindoro Oil-Type / Shoreline Support

- Light oil: final beached fraction `0.02%`; first arrival `4 h`; impacted segments `11`; QC pass
- Fixed-base medium-heavy proxy: final beached fraction `0.61%`; first arrival `4 h`; impacted segments `10`; QC flagged
- Heavier oil: final beached fraction `0.63%`; first arrival `4 h`; impacted segments `11`; QC pass

## 6. What The Verification Step Writes

The panel verification step reads stored outputs and writes only to:

- `output/panel_review_check/panel_results_match_check.csv`
- `output/panel_review_check/panel_results_match_check.json`
- `output/panel_review_check/panel_results_match_check.md`
- `output/panel_review_check/panel_review_manifest.json`

## 7. Which Commands Are Panel-Safe

Main panel-safe entry points:

```powershell
.\panel.ps1
.\start.ps1 -Panel
.\start.ps1 -List -NoPause
.\start.ps1 -Help -NoPause
.\start.ps1 -Explain mindoro_phase3b_primary_public_validation -ExportPlan -NoPause
```

macOS with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install powershell
pwsh ./panel.ps1
pwsh ./start.ps1 -Panel
pwsh ./start.ps1 -List -NoPause
pwsh ./start.ps1 -Help -NoPause
```

Read-only / packaging-only launcher entries:

```powershell
.\start.ps1 -Entry b1_drifter_context_panel
.\start.ps1 -Entry final_validation_package
.\start.ps1 -Entry phase5_sync
.\start.ps1 -Entry figure_package_publication
.\start.ps1 -Entry trajectory_gallery
.\start.ps1 -Entry trajectory_gallery_panel
```

Dashboard:

```bash
docker compose exec pipeline python -m streamlit run ui/app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501
```

Data sources and provenance:

```powershell
docs\DATA_SOURCES.md
```

## 8. Inspecting Drifter Provenance Behind `B1`

Panel members can use panel option `7` or:

```powershell
.\start.ps1 -Entry b1_drifter_context_panel
```

That view stays stored-output-only.

- It explains the focused historical Phase 1 provenance behind the selected recipe.
- It does not turn drifters into the March 13-14 truth mask.
- It makes the claim boundary explicit: B1 drifter provenance is not the direct March 13-14 public-observation validation truth.
- It explicitly says when no direct March 13-14 2023 accepted drifter segment is stored for `B1`.

## 9. Inspecting Data Sources And Provenance

Panel members can use panel option `8` to view `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md`.

That registry is read-only. It never downloads inputs, reruns workflows, rewrites scientific outputs, or changes the claim boundary.

## 10. Why `B1` Is The Main Mindoro Row

`B1` is the promoted March 13-14 `R1_previous` row carried into the main validation argument.

- It is the only main-text primary Mindoro validation row.
- It supports coastal-neighborhood usefulness, not exact 1 km overlap.
- The March 13-14 `R0` branch is preserved for archive/provenance.
- The other March-family rows remain useful context, but they are not replacements for `B1`.

## 11. Why The Observation Independence Note Matters

The March 13 and March 14 public products are independent NOAA-published day-specific public observations.

That means the row can be described as an independent day-to-day observation pair, while still being clear that the model evaluation is a reinitialization-based public-observation validation from the March 13 seed to the March 14 target.

## 12. Which Commands Are Researcher / Audit Reruns

These belong to the full launcher and are not the default defense path:

```powershell
.\start.ps1 -Entry phase1_mindoro_focus_provenance
.\start.ps1 -Entry mindoro_phase3b_primary_public_validation
.\start.ps1 -Entry dwh_reportable_bundle
.\start.ps1 -Entry mindoro_reportable_core
.\start.ps1 -Entry phase1_regional_reference_rerun
.\start.ps1 -Entry mindoro_appendix_sensitivity_bundle
```

Use them only when you intentionally want researcher or audit reruns.
