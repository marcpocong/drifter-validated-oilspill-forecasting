# Architecture

## Workflow Separation

This repo intentionally keeps four stories separate:

- historical/regional transport validation
- spill-case forecast generation and validation
- oil-type and shoreline interpretation
- launcher/docs/reproducibility packaging

That separation is now explicit in both the code and the launcher. The project no longer relies on a single stale "Mindoro full chain" entrypoint.

## Lane Model

- `prototype_2016`: backward-compatible legacy/debug lane only
- `mindoro_retro_2023`: main Philippine spill-case lane
- `dwh_retro_2010`: external rich-data transfer-validation lane

The preserved prototype lane is not the final Phase 1 scientific evidence base. It is retained so older transport-validation logic can still be debugged and regression-checked.

## Phase 1 Boundary

Target architecture:

- historical window 2016-2022
- fixed regional validation box
- drogued-only core pool
- non-overlapping 72 h segments
- HYCOM/CMEMS crossed with GFS/ERA5 recipe family
- explicit loading-audit hard-fail behavior
- frozen baseline artifact for downstream spill cases

Current local state:

- the architecture is audited and the target metadata is recorded
- the historical 2016-2022 accepted/rejected segment corpus is still missing
- the final frozen baseline story therefore remains open

## Phase 2 Boundary

Target architecture:

- deterministic control separate from the ensemble
- fixed canonical product names and unchanged `mask_p50` / `mask_p90` semantics
- 50-member ensemble design
- date-composite logic
- same-grid discipline
- loading audits, manifests, provenance, and honesty fields

Current local state:

- the implemented Phase 2 workflow is scientifically usable
- it is not yet scientifically frozen
- legacy `*_ncep` drift is still present in config/runtime space
- no local `gfs_wind.nc` is present, so the full official GFS-capable recipe family is not yet locally available

## Phase 3 Boundary

Mindoro and DWH serve different roles:

- Mindoro Phase 3A/3B establishes thesis-case comparator, strict stress-test, and broader-support interpretation
- DWH Phase 3C provides external rich-data transfer validation

These should not be collapsed into a single validation claim. Mindoro remains the main Philippine case; DWH remains the external rich-data transfer benchmark.

## Phase 4 Boundary

Phase 4 is now a real workflow, not a placeholder shell:

- dedicated scenario registry in `config/phase4_oil_scenarios.csv`
- reuse of the current reportable transport branch rather than rerunning scoring logic
- shoreline assignment tied to the existing canonical shoreline segments
- separate output bundle under `output/phase4/CASE_MINDORO_RETRO_2023/`

Phase 4 is reportable now for Mindoro, but it still inherits upstream provisional status from the unfinished Phase 1/2 freeze story.

## Phase 5 Boundary

Phase 5 is the project synchronization layer:

- launcher/menu rationalization
- docs synchronization
- reproducibility/package indexes
- honest cross-phase status registry

It is intentionally non-scientific in scope. It reuses existing scientific artifacts rather than recomputing them.

## Launcher Architecture

The launcher source of truth is `config/launcher_matrix.json`. It defines:

- category separation
- workflow mode
- service mix (`pipeline` or `gnome`)
- rerun cost
- safe read-only defaults
- step sequence
- optional future work that is still not implemented

`start.ps1` now reads that matrix directly. This means:

- current menu options match the actual repo state
- prototype mode remains available without being misrepresented
- read-only utilities are visible and easy to run
- non-existent UI or gallery features are not advertised as if they already exist

## Packaging Architecture

The repo now has two different packaging layers:

- `output/final_validation_package/`: frozen thesis validation package built from completed scientific outputs
- `output/final_reproducibility_package/`: Phase 5 synchronization layer that indexes software versions, cases, configs, manifests, outputs, logs, and honest phase status

Phase 5 reuses the final validation package rather than replacing it. The validation package remains the thesis summary bundle; the reproducibility package is the reproducibility/indexing layer around the current repo state.
