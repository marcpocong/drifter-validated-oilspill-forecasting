# Architecture

## Workflow Separation

This repo intentionally keeps four stories separate:

- historical/regional transport validation
- spill-case forecast generation and validation
- oil-type and shoreline interpretation
- launcher/docs/reproducibility packaging

That separation is now explicit in both the code and the launcher. The project no longer relies on a single stale "Mindoro full chain" entrypoint.

## Lane Model

- `prototype_2016`: backward-compatible legacy/debug lane only, now with an explicit six-recipe prototype debug family, a padded forcing-prep window that preserves the legacy `+/- 3 h` ensemble jitter, a visible `Phase 1 -> Phase 2 -> Phase 3A -> Phase 4` support story, a consolidated multi-track OpenDrift-vs-PyGNOME Phase 3A comparator package, and a drifter-of-record-seeded legacy Phase 4 weathering path
- `prototype_2021`: preferred accepted-segment debug/demo lane built from the two fixed 2021 strict-gate drifter segments, restricted to the official Phase 1 recipe family, and intentionally scoped to the transport-core bundle only
- `mindoro_retro_2023`: main Philippine spill-case lane
- `dwh_retro_2010`: external rich-data transfer-validation lane
- `phase1_regional_2016_2022`: dedicated historical/regional Phase 1 scientific rerun lane

Neither prototype lane is the final Phase 1 scientific evidence base. `prototype_2021` is the preferred debug/demo path, while `prototype_2016` is retained so older transport-validation logic can still be debugged and regression-checked.

## Phase 1 Boundary

Target architecture:

- historical window 2016-2022
- fixed regional validation box
- drogued-only core pool
- non-overlapping 72 h segments
- HYCOM/CMEMS crossed with GFS/ERA5 recipe family
- explicit loading-audit hard-fail behavior
- frozen baseline artifact for downstream spill cases

Current local state:

- the dedicated `phase1_production_rerun` lane now materializes the missing 2016-2022 accepted/rejected corpus, loading audit, metrics, summary, ranking, and staged candidate baseline under `output/phase1_production_rerun/`
- the official Phase 1 audit box/window is `119.5-124.5E / 11.5-16.5N` over `2016-2022`
- the current default spill-case baseline remains `config/phase1_baseline_selection.yaml`, whose evidence base is still the preserved `2016-09-01`, `2016-09-06`, and `2016-09-17` prototype rankings
- the regional rerun is scientific-only by default and does not auto-run `phase1_audit` or `phase5_sync`
- `config/phase1_baseline_selection.yaml` is intentionally not overwritten; downstream spill-case use of the staged candidate should go through `BASELINE_SELECTION_PATH` or an explicit promotion decision

## Phase 2 Boundary

Target architecture:

- deterministic control separate from the ensemble
- fixed canonical product names and unchanged `mask_p50` / `mask_p90` semantics
- 50-member ensemble design
- date-composite logic
- same-grid discipline
- loading audits, manifests, provenance, and honesty fields

Current local state:

- the implemented Phase 2 workflow is scientifically usable
- it is not yet scientifically frozen
- legacy `*_ncep` drift is still present in config/runtime space for backward compatibility
- the dedicated Phase 1 production lane now evaluates only `cmems_era5`, `cmems_gfs`, `hycom_era5`, and `hycom_gfs`
- the spill-case lane still needs deliberate candidate-baseline adoption before the new Phase 1 evidence becomes its default upstream baseline

## Phase 3 Boundary

Mindoro and DWH serve different roles:

- Mindoro Phase 3A/3B establishes thesis-case comparator, strict stress-test, and broader-support interpretation
- DWH Phase 3C provides external rich-data transfer validation

These should not be collapsed into a single validation claim. Mindoro remains the main Philippine case; DWH remains the external rich-data transfer benchmark.
Within Mindoro, the original March 3 -> March 6 case definition remains frozen in `config/case_mindoro_retro_2023.yaml`, while the promoted March 13 -> March 14 B1 row is recorded separately in `config/case_mindoro_retro_2023_phase3b_primary_validation_amendment.yaml`. This preserves provenance and keeps March 6 visible as a legacy honesty-only row instead of silently rewriting history.
The March 13 -> March 14 row is therefore the canonical public-validation row for thesis reporting, but it still carries a shared-imagery guardrail because both NOAA/NESDIS public products cite the same March 12 WorldView-3 imagery. PyGNOME remains comparator-only in that promoted lane.

Unlike Mindoro, DWH Phase 3C does not use a Phase 1 drifter-selected forcing recipe. It uses a frozen historical forcing stack chosen by a scientific-readiness gate: the first complete real current+wind+wave stack for the DWH May 20-23, 2010 window that is not smoke-only, spans the required window, exposes the required variables with usable metadata, opens cleanly in the OpenDrift reader, and passes a small end-to-end reader-check forecast. In the current repo state, that frozen DWH stack is HYCOM GOFS 3.1 currents plus ERA5 winds plus CMEMS wave/Stokes.
Observed DWH daily masks remain truth, the cumulative DWH layer remains context-only, and PyGNOME remains comparator-only within that separate external-case story.

## Phase 4 Boundary

Phase 4 is now a real workflow, not a placeholder shell:

- dedicated scenario registry in `config/phase4_oil_scenarios.csv`
- reuse of the current reportable transport branch rather than rerunning scoring logic
- shoreline assignment tied to the existing canonical shoreline segments
- separate output bundle under `output/phase4/CASE_MINDORO_RETRO_2023/`

Phase 4 is reportable now for Mindoro, but it still inherits upstream provisional status from the unfinished Phase 1/2 freeze story.
The repo's existing PyGNOME branches remain Phase 3-style transport comparators, so a separate read-only `phase4_crossmodel_comparability_audit` is now the guardrail that decides whether any OpenDrift-versus-PyGNOME Phase 4 comparison is scientifically defensible. In the current repo state, that audit is deferred rather than promoted to a result because matched PyGNOME fate-and-shoreline outputs do not yet exist.
This is also why the prototype/debug drifter lanes should be framed as support only rather than as proof that official `Phase 4 = Oil-Type Fate and Shoreline Impact Analysis` has been validated there. For the preserved `prototype_2016` lane specifically, the honest legacy framing is `Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Phase 3A / Phase 4`, with no thesis-facing `Phase 3B` or `Phase 3C`.

## Phase 5 Boundary

Phase 5 is the project synchronization layer:

- launcher/menu rationalization
- docs synchronization
- reproducibility/package indexes
- honest cross-phase status registry
- read-only local dashboard over the packaged outputs and figure layers

It is intentionally non-scientific in scope. It reuses existing scientific artifacts rather than recomputing them.

## Launcher Architecture

The launcher source of truth is `config/launcher_matrix.json`. It defines:

- category separation
- workflow mode
- service mix (`pipeline` or `gnome`)
- rerun cost
- safe read-only defaults
- step sequence
- optional future work that is still not implemented

`start.ps1` now reads that matrix directly. This means:

- current menu options match the actual repo state
- prototype mode remains available without being misrepresented
- read-only utilities are visible and easy to run
- non-existent UI features are not advertised as if they already exist, while the implemented raw gallery, panel gallery, and publication-grade figure package are exposed honestly as separate safe utilities
- the expensive `phase1_production_rerun` scientific entry exists as a separate historical/regional workflow instead of being hidden inside the Mindoro spill-case bundle
- the promoted Mindoro B1 row now has its own canonical scientific entry, `mindoro_phase3b_primary_public_validation`, while `mindoro_march13_14_noaa_reinit_stress_test` survives only as a backward-compatible alias

## Packaging Architecture

The repo now has two different packaging layers:

- `output/final_validation_package/`: frozen thesis validation package built from completed scientific outputs
- `output/final_reproducibility_package/`: Phase 5 synchronization layer that indexes software versions, cases, configs, manifests, outputs, logs, and honest phase status
- `output/prototype_2021_pygnome_similarity/`: read-only preferred accepted-segment debug support package built from the fixed 2021 deterministic OpenDrift-vs-PyGNOME cases
- `output/prototype_2016_pygnome_similarity/`: read-only legacy/debug Phase 3A comparator package that consolidates the three prototype 2016 OpenDrift deterministic plus `p50`/`p90` support tracks against deterministic PyGNOME
- `output/trajectory_gallery/`: read-only technical gallery built from existing trajectories, rasters, overlays, and Phase 4 artifacts
- `output/trajectory_gallery_panel/`: read-only polished panel-ready board pack built from the raw gallery and the same stored source artifacts
- `output/figure_package_publication/`: read-only canonical publication-grade package built from stored rasters, tracks, manifests, and Phase 4 tables for defense and paper use
- `ui/`: read-only local dashboard that consumes those packages and archives without becoming a scientific rerun surface

Phase 5 reuses the final validation package rather than replacing it. The validation package remains the thesis summary bundle; the reproducibility package is the reproducibility/indexing layer around the current repo state; the prototype PyGNOME similarity package is a legacy/debug comparator summary only; the raw trajectory gallery is the technical figure archive; the polished panel gallery is the intermediate non-technical review layer; the publication figure package is the canonical presentation layer for defense slides and paper-ready single figures; and the UI is the read-only local explorer over that same packaged state.
The Mindoro packaging outputs now also carry explicit provenance fields for the promoted B1 row, including the frozen base case path, the amendment path, the row role, launcher IDs, and the shared-imagery caveat so that the primary/legacy distinction survives into downstream tables and figure manifests.
