# Architecture

## Workflow Separation

This repo intentionally keeps four stories separate:

- historical/regional transport validation
- spill-case forecast generation and validation
- support-only oil-type and shoreline interpretation outside the main thesis phase count
- read-only launcher/docs/reproducibility packaging and exploration support

That separation is now explicit in both the code and the launcher. The project no longer relies on a single stale "Mindoro full chain" entrypoint.

## Lane Model

- `prototype_2016`: backward-compatible legacy/debug lane only, now with an explicit six-recipe prototype debug family, a padded forcing-prep window that preserves the legacy `+/- 3 h` ensemble jitter, a visible `Phase 1 -> Phase 2 -> Phase 3A -> Phase 4 -> Phase 5` support story, a consolidated multi-track OpenDrift-vs-PyGNOME Phase 3A comparator package, a drifter-of-record-seeded legacy Phase 4 weathering path, and a legacy Phase 5 figure/package story
- `prototype_2021`: preferred accepted-segment debug/demo lane built from the two fixed 2021 strict-gate drifter segments, restricted to the official Phase 1 recipe family, and intentionally scoped to the transport-core bundle only
- `mindoro_retro_2023`: main Philippine spill-case validation lane, with the separate focused Phase 1 provenance path kept outside the canonical spill-case builder
- `phase1_mindoro_focus_pre_spill_2016_2023`: separate Mindoro-focused Phase 1 provenance lane for the B1 recipe story
- `dwh_retro_2010`: external rich-data transfer-validation lane
- `phase1_regional_2016_2022`: dedicated historical/regional Phase 1 scientific rerun lane preserved as the broader reference/governance lane

Neither prototype lane is the final Phase 1 scientific evidence base. `prototype_2021` is the preferred debug/demo path, while `prototype_2016` is retained so older transport-validation logic can still be debugged and regression-checked. More specifically, `prototype_2016` preserves the earliest prototype stage of the study. The very first prototype code used the shared first-code search box `[108.6465, 121.3655, 6.1865, 20.3515]` on the west coast of the Philippines (Palawan-side western Philippine context). Because the ingestion-and-validation pipeline was still in its early stage, that first code surfaced the first three 2016 drifter cases, and the team then intentionally kept those three as the first study focus to build the workflow and prove the pipeline was working. This historical-origin note does not replace the stored per-case local prototype extents, which remain the operative scientific/display extents. Methodologically, that legacy lane shows that the early pipeline could carry drifter-driven transport validation through Phase 1 and Phase 2, then through a Phase 3A OpenDrift-versus-deterministic-PyGNOME comparator check using fraction skill score, before continuing into legacy Phase 4 weathering/fate work and the legacy Phase 5 figure/package story. Its comparator result remains support-only: a non-zero FSS means the ensemble footprint was not completely disjoint from the deterministic PyGNOME forecast, not that PyGNOME is truth or that the prototype lane is final proof.

## Phase 1 Boundary

Target architecture:

- historical window 2016-2022
- fixed regional validation box
- drogued-only core pool
- non-overlapping 72 h segments
- HYCOM/CMEMS crossed with GFS/ERA5 recipe family
- explicit loading-audit hard-fail behavior
- frozen baseline artifact for downstream spill cases

Current local state:

- the dedicated `phase1_production_rerun` lane now materializes the missing 2016-2022 accepted/rejected corpus, loading audit, metrics, summary, ranking, and staged candidate baseline under `output/phase1_production_rerun/`
- the official Phase 1 audit box/window is `119.5-124.5E / 11.5-16.5N` over `2016-2022`
- the active thesis-facing Mindoro-focused provenance box is kept separate at `118.751-124.305E / 10.620-16.026N`, and the publication package now includes a shared study-box reference figure that foregrounds `mindoro_case_domain` plus the prototype_2016 historical-origin box while preserving focused-box and scoring-grid geography panels as archived secondary references instead of collapsing everything into one extent
- the current default spill-case baseline remains `config/phase1_baseline_selection.yaml`, whose evidence base is still the preserved `2016-09-01`, `2016-09-06`, and `2016-09-17` prototype rankings
- the regional rerun is scientific-only by default and does not auto-run `phase1_audit` or `phase5_sync`
- forcing-provider outages are now mediated by one shared policy surface, `FORCING_OUTAGE_POLICY=default|continue_degraded|fail_hard`; the strict/reportable regional rerun still fails hard by default if the official recipe family becomes incomplete
- forcing-provider calls also run through a shared fail-fast budget layer, `FORCING_SOURCE_BUDGET_SECONDS` defaulting to `300`, so broken providers stop quickly instead of consuming long retry chains across the whole phase
- the dedicated historical Phase 1 reruns now persist their monthly drifter chunks and per-month forcing files under `data/historical_validation_inputs/<workflow_mode>/...`, with `output/.../_scratch` retained only for transient segment scratch and legacy monthly-cache backfill
- `config/phase1_baseline_selection.yaml` is intentionally not overwritten; downstream spill-case use of the staged candidate should go through `BASELINE_SELECTION_PATH` or an explicit promotion decision

## Phase 2 Boundary

Target architecture:

- deterministic control separate from the ensemble
- fixed canonical product names and unchanged `mask_p50` / `mask_p90` semantics
- 50-member ensemble design
- date-composite logic
- same-grid discipline
- loading audits, manifests, provenance, and honesty fields

Current local state:

- the implemented Phase 2 workflow is scientifically usable
- it is not yet scientifically frozen
- legacy `*_ncep` drift is still present in config/runtime space for backward compatibility
- the dedicated Phase 1 production lane now evaluates only `cmems_era5`, `cmems_gfs`, `hycom_era5`, and `hycom_gfs`
- the spill-case lane still needs deliberate candidate-baseline adoption before the new Phase 1 evidence becomes its default upstream baseline

## Phase 3 Boundary

Mindoro and DWH serve different roles:

- Mindoro Phase 3A/3B establishes thesis-case comparator and public-observation validation
- DWH Phase 3C provides external transfer validation

These should not be collapsed into a single validation claim. Mindoro remains the main Philippine case; DWH remains the external rich-data transfer benchmark.
Within Mindoro, the original March 3 -> March 6 case definition remains frozen in `config/case_mindoro_retro_2023.yaml`, while the promoted March 13 -> March 14 R1 primary validation row is recorded separately in `config/case_mindoro_retro_2023_phase3b_primary_validation_amendment.yaml`. This preserves provenance without silently rewriting history.
The March 13 -> March 14 R1 row is therefore the canonical public-validation row for thesis reporting under the thesis-facing title `Phase 3B Observation-Based Spatial Validation Using Public Mindoro Spill Extents`, but it still carries a shared-imagery guardrail because both NOAA/NESDIS public products cite the same March 12 WorldView-3 imagery. PyGNOME remains comparator-only in that promoted lane.
The March 13 -> March 14 R0 archived baseline plus the preserved March-family legacy rows remain repo-preserved archive-only provenance material and are intentionally routed to archive surfaces rather than to the main thesis-facing Mindoro page.
The separate `phase1_mindoro_focus_pre_spill_2016_2023` drifter rerun is now the active Mindoro-specific recipe-provenance lane for B1. Its completed four-recipe historical winner is `cmems_gfs`, and the official B1 artifact now also uses `cmems_gfs`. This does not rewrite the raw-generation history of the stored March 13 -> March 14 science bundle.
The focused rerun searched through early 2023, but its accepted registry does not include near-2023 accepted segments.
Thesis-facing Mindoro sequencing is therefore separate focused drifter-based Phase 1 provenance -> Phase 2 -> Phase 3B primary validation, with the same-case March 13 -> March 14 PyGNOME lane kept as supporting comparator evidence rather than truth.

Unlike Mindoro, DWH Phase 3C does not use a Phase 1 drifter-selected forcing recipe. It uses a frozen historical forcing stack chosen by a scientific-readiness gate: the first complete real current+wind+wave stack for the DWH May 20-23, 2010 window that is not smoke-only, spans the required window, exposes the required variables with usable metadata, opens cleanly in the OpenDrift reader, and passes a small end-to-end reader-check forecast. In the current repo state, that frozen DWH stack is HYCOM GOFS 3.1 currents plus ERA5 winds plus CMEMS wave/Stokes.
Observed DWH daily masks remain truth, the cumulative DWH layer remains context-only, and PyGNOME remains comparator-only within that separate external-case story.

## Phase 4 Support Boundary

Outside `prototype_2016`, `phase4_oiltype_and_shoreline` is a real technical support workflow rather than a main thesis phase:

- dedicated scenario registry in `config/phase4_oil_scenarios.csv`
- reuse of the current reportable transport branch rather than rerunning scoring logic
- shoreline assignment tied to the existing canonical shoreline segments
- separate output bundle under `output/phase4/CASE_MINDORO_RETRO_2023/`

This support bundle can be reported honestly as technical/context output for Mindoro, but it still inherits upstream provisional status from the unfinished Phase 1/2 freeze story.
The repo's existing PyGNOME branches remain Phase 3-style transport comparators, so a separate read-only `phase4_crossmodel_comparability_audit` is now the guardrail that decides whether any OpenDrift-versus-PyGNOME Phase 4 comparison is scientifically defensible. In the current repo state, that audit is deferred rather than promoted to a result because matched PyGNOME fate-and-shoreline outputs do not yet exist.
This is also why the prototype/debug drifter lanes should be framed as support only rather than as proof that official `phase4_oiltype_and_shoreline` validation has been completed there. For the preserved `prototype_2016` lane specifically, the honest legacy framing is `Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Phase 3A / Phase 4 / Phase 5`, with no thesis-facing `Phase 3B` or `Phase 3C`.
For that lane, the release origin is the selected drifter-of-record start from `data/drifters/CASE_2016-*/drifters_noaa.csv`. Legacy `source_point_metadata.geojson` paths may still survive in some compatibility-oriented audit fields, but they are not the actual release geometry for the 2016 oil/weathering runs.

## Phase 5 Support Boundary

Outside `prototype_2016`, `phase5_sync` and the downstream galleries/UI are project support layers rather than main thesis phases:

- launcher/menu rationalization
- docs synchronization
- reproducibility/package indexes
- honest cross-phase status registry
- read-only local dashboard over the packaged outputs and figure layers

It is intentionally non-scientific in scope. It reuses existing scientific artifacts rather than recomputing them. Thesis-facing `Phase 5` language is reserved for the preserved `prototype_2016` legacy-runs story.

## Launcher Architecture

The launcher source of truth is `config/launcher_matrix.json`. It defines:

- category separation
- workflow mode
- service mix (`pipeline` or `gnome`)
- rerun cost
- safe read-only defaults
- step sequence
- optional future work that is still not implemented

`start.ps1` now reads that matrix directly. This means:

- current menu options match the actual repo state
- prototype mode remains available without being misrepresented
- read-only utilities are visible and easy to run
- non-existent UI features are not advertised as if they already exist, while the implemented raw gallery, panel gallery, and publication-grade figure package are exposed honestly as separate safe utilities
- the expensive `phase1_production_rerun` scientific entry exists as a separate historical/regional workflow instead of being hidden inside the Mindoro spill-case bundle
- the promoted Mindoro B1 row now has its own canonical scientific entry, `mindoro_phase3b_primary_public_validation`, while `mindoro_march13_14_noaa_reinit_stress_test` survives only as a backward-compatible alias
- standardized degraded forcing skips can bubble up with a dedicated exit code so appendix/legacy/experimental launcher entries can continue honestly after a forcing-only outage, while reportable lanes remain strict by default

## Packaging Architecture

The repo now has two different packaging layers:

- `output/final_validation_package/`: frozen thesis validation package built from completed scientific outputs
- `output/final_reproducibility_package/`: read-only reproducibility/support layer that indexes software versions, cases, configs, manifests, outputs, logs, and honest phase status
- `output/prototype_2021_pygnome_similarity/`: read-only preferred accepted-segment debug support package built from the fixed 2021 deterministic OpenDrift-vs-PyGNOME cases
- `output/prototype_2016_pygnome_similarity/`: read-only legacy/debug Phase 3A comparator package that consolidates the three prototype 2016 OpenDrift deterministic plus `p50`/`p90` support tracks against deterministic PyGNOME
- `output/2016 Legacy Runs FINAL Figures/`: read-only curated prototype_2016 final paper-figure pack with per-case drifter, ensemble, PyGNOME, and PyGNOME-vs-ensemble exports plus explicit missing-figure diagnostics and historical-origin metadata for the shared first-code search box that framed the first three 2016 drifter cases
- `output/trajectory_gallery/`: read-only technical gallery built from existing trajectories, rasters, overlays, and Phase 4 support artifacts
- `output/trajectory_gallery_panel/`: read-only polished panel-ready board pack built from the raw gallery and the same stored source artifacts
- `output/figure_package_publication/`: read-only canonical publication-grade package built from stored rasters, tracks, manifests, Phase 4 support tables, and shared thesis box metadata for defense and paper use
- `output/Phase 3B March13-14 Final Output/`: read-only curated export of the promoted B1 family, built from the publication package plus the stored canonical March 13 -> March 14 scientific source artifacts
- `ui/`: read-only local dashboard that consumes those packages and archives without becoming a scientific rerun surface

The repo support layers reuse the final validation package rather than replacing it. The validation package remains the thesis summary bundle; the reproducibility package is the reproducibility/indexing layer around the current repo state; the prototype PyGNOME similarity package is a legacy/debug comparator summary only; the curated `2016 Legacy Runs FINAL Figures` folder is the prototype_2016-specific paper-facing export and legacy Phase 5 figure story; the raw trajectory gallery is the technical figure archive; the polished panel gallery is the intermediate non-technical review layer; the publication figure package is the canonical generic presentation layer for defense slides and paper-ready single figures, now including a shared thesis study-box reference figure that foregrounds `mindoro_case_domain` plus the prototype-origin box, an archived full-context overview, and per-box geography panels built from stored box metadata only; the dedicated `Phase 3B March13-14 Final Output` folder is the read-only curated export of the promoted B1 validation family; and the UI is the read-only local explorer over that same packaged state.
The Mindoro packaging outputs now also carry explicit provenance fields for the promoted B1 row, including the frozen base case path, the amendment path, the row role, launcher IDs, and the shared-imagery caveat so that the primary/legacy distinction survives into downstream tables and figure manifests.
