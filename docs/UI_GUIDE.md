# UI Guide

## Purpose

The Streamlit dashboard is a read-only thesis review surface over already packaged artifacts. It presents stored outputs, figures, registries, and governance notes; it must not rerun science, mutate outputs, rewrite manifests, edit configs, or reinterpret stored result values.

## Layout System

The redesigned UI uses a shared card-and-section system in `ui/pages/common.py` so pages read like a modern thesis-defense microsite rather than a stack of default Streamlit alerts. The main defense pages follow this pattern:

1. Modern hero with the page title, evidence-role pill, and one-sentence purpose.
2. Key takeaway card for panel-facing interpretation.
3. Main result area with feature figures, metric cards, or comparison cards.
4. Caveat or boundary ribbon that keeps evidence limits visible.
5. Details section for tables, registries, notes, and extra figures.
6. Archive/support material separated visually from the main claim.

Archive, legacy, reference, and advanced pages use the same helpers, but with muted archive/advanced styling so they remain visibly secondary.

## Reusable Helpers

Primary shared helpers live in `ui/pages/common.py`:

- `render_modern_hero(...)`
- `render_key_takeaway(...)`
- `render_caveat_ribbon(...)`
- `render_support_notice(...)`
- `render_archive_notice(...)`
- `render_evidence_path(...)`
- `render_feature_card(...)`
- `render_feature_grid(...)`
- `render_metric_story_grid(...)`
- `render_section_header(...)`
- `render_figure_feature(...)`
- `render_page_footer_note(...)`
- Existing read-only table, gallery, package, markdown, badge, and export helpers.

These helpers use escaped HTML where appropriate and should remain dependency-free beyond the existing Streamlit/Pandas/Pillow stack.

## Running The Dashboard

Start the pipeline container if needed:

```powershell
if (-not (Test-Path .env)) { Copy-Item .env.example .env }
docker compose up -d pipeline
```

Launch Streamlit:

```powershell
docker compose exec pipeline python -m streamlit run ui/app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

For print/export review, append `?export=1` to a page URL. Export mode hides sidebar/navigation chrome and keeps cards/figures print-friendly.

## Viewing Modes

Panel-friendly mode is the default. It should show the main defense story first:

1. Defense / Panel Review
2. Phase 1 Transport Provenance
3. Mindoro B1 Primary Validation
4. Mindoro Track A Comparator Support
5. DWH External Transfer Validation
6. Mindoro Oil-Type and Shoreline Context
7. Archive / Support Only pages as secondary material
8. Reference pages for provenance and registries

Advanced mode exposes technical inspection layers:

- B1 Recipe Provenance — Not Truth Mask
- Phase 4 Cross-Model Status
- Trajectory Explorer
- Raw/panel galleries and registry previews where available

Advanced pages are audit surfaces only. They should not look like primary validation pages.

## Evidence Guardrails

Keep these claims stable across page text, labels, captions, and export views:

- Focused Mindoro Phase 1 is transport provenance / recipe selection, not oil-footprint truth.
- Mindoro B1 is the only main Philippine public-observation validation claim.
- B1 supports coastal-neighborhood usefulness, not exact 1 km overlap.
- The March 13–14 B1 case keeps the shared-imagery / reinitialization caveat visible.
- Mindoro Track A and PyGNOME are comparator-only support.
- DWH is external transfer validation; it does not recalibrate Mindoro.
- Mindoro oil-type and shoreline outputs are support/context only.
- Legacy/archive outputs are preserved for provenance, audit, and reproducibility only.
- UI/publication packages are presentation and governance surfaces over stored outputs only.

## Read-Only Rules

UI work may modify presentation files such as:

- `ui/app.py`
- `ui/assets/style.css`
- `ui/pages/common.py`
- `ui/pages/*.py`
- `docs/UI_GUIDE.md`

UI work must not modify:

- `output/`
- `data_processed/`
- science scripts or rerun pipelines
- configs/manifests that define scientific runs
- stored scorecards or scientific result values

The dashboard should fail softly if optional artifacts are absent, but it must never fill gaps by generating new science.

## Visual QA Checklist

Before review, check the app at laptop and projector widths:

- Main pages should use cards, ribbons, metrics, and figure boards, not piles of default `st.info` / `st.warning` blocks.
- Long metric values should wrap cleanly without horizontal overflow.
- Figure cards should keep captions readable and avoid large empty gaps.
- Sidebar navigation should be readable, structured, and less visually dominant than the page content.
- Archive and legacy pages should use muted hero/card styling and remain visually secondary.
- Export mode should hide chrome and avoid breaking inside hero/cards where possible.

## Branding

Optional branding assets are supported and should fail gracefully when missing:

- `ui/assets/logo.svg` or `ui/assets/logo.png`
- `ui/assets/logo_icon.svg` or `ui/assets/logo_icon.png`

See `docs/UI_BRANDING.md` and `ui/assets/README.md` for asset naming guidance.
