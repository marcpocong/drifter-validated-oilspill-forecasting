# Phase Status

## Current Project Verdict

- Phase 1: Mindoro-specific recipe provenance is now finalized through the separate focused `2016-2023` drifter rerun, which recorded `cmems_gfs` as the historical four-recipe winner and now promotes `cmems_gfs` directly into the official B1 artifact; the broader `2016-2022` regional rerun remains preserved as a reference/governance lane and currently selects `cmems_gfs`.
- Phase 2: scientifically usable, not frozen.
- Mindoro Phase 3: validation-focused and reportable; `Phase 3B Observation-Based Spatial Validation Using Public Mindoro Spill Extents` is now carried thesis-facing by the March 13 -> March 14 R1 primary validation row, the March 13 -> March 14 R0 archived baseline plus the preserved March-family rows remain repo-preserved archive-only provenance material, the promotion is tracked by amendment rather than by rewriting the frozen March 3 -> March 6 case file, and B1 now inherits its recipe provenance from the separate focused `2016-2023` Mindoro drifter rerun without claiming direct drifter ingestion inside Phase 3B itself.
- DWH Phase 3C: frozen validation-only external rich-data transfer case kept separate from drifter-calibration governance.
- Mindoro `phase4_oiltype_and_shoreline`: implemented as a support/context bundle outside the main thesis phase count; thesis-facing `Phase 4` labeling is reserved for `prototype_2016`.
- Phase 4 cross-model comparison: no matched Mindoro Phase 4 PyGNOME package is stored yet; current PyGNOME branches remain comparator-only for transport/spatial work rather than matched Phase 4 fate-and-shoreline outputs.
- Repo sync, galleries, publication packaging, and dashboard layers: read-only support/explorer surfaces outside the main thesis phase count; thesis-facing `Phase 5` labeling is reserved for `prototype_2016`.
- Trajectory gallery: read-only technical figure set built from existing outputs only.
- Trajectory gallery panel pack: read-only polished board layer for non-technical review, built from existing outputs only.
- Publication figure package: canonical publication-grade defense/paper figure layer built from existing outputs only, with honest Phase 3 cross-model boards and a Phase 4 deferred-comparison note figure.
- Read-only local dashboard: implemented support/explorer layer over the publication package, panel/raw figure archives, reproducibility indexes, and the Phase 4 cross-model audit.

## Phase 1

- Plain-language status: the focused `2016-2023` Mindoro rerun now provides the active spill-case recipe provenance in `config/phase1_baseline_selection.yaml`, while the dedicated `2016-2022` historical/regional production rerun is preserved as a broader reference/governance lane and still stages its own regional candidate artifact.
- Scientifically reportable: `true`
- Scientifically frozen: `mindoro_specific_b1_provenance_finalized_broader_regional_reference_not_frozen`
- Inherited provisional: `false`
- Official Phase 1 audit box/window: `119.5-124.5E / 11.5-16.5N`, `2016-2022`
- Forcing-outage policy: strict/reportable by default. If a provider outage removes part of the official recipe family, the dedicated scientific lane now fails hard unless you explicitly set `FORCING_OUTAGE_POLICY=continue_degraded`.
- Forcing-provider acquisition is also fail-fast now: each forcing source gets a shared `FORCING_SOURCE_BUDGET_SECONDS` wall-clock budget with a default of `300` seconds, while drifter truth and ArcGIS/observation truth remain strict inputs outside that timeout policy.
- Biggest remaining follow-up: the focused Mindoro provenance lane is complete and official B1 now uses `cmems_gfs`; the remaining Phase 1 science follow-up is the broader `2016-2022` regional/reference lane, which is still not finalized as a completed multi-year frozen study.
- Separate Mindoro-focused note: the `phase1_mindoro_focus_pre_spill_2016_2023` rerun is now the active Mindoro-specific recipe-provenance lane for B1. It searched through early 2023, but its accepted registry does not include near-2023 accepted segments.

What is already in place:

- dedicated `WORKFLOW_MODE=phase1_regional_2016_2022` and `PIPELINE_PHASE=phase1_production_rerun`
- consolidated `output/phase1_production_rerun/phase1_drifter_registry.csv` with accepted/rejected status, reject reasons, drogue fields, non-overlap status, and regional-box status
- accepted/rejected segment registries, loading audit, segment metrics, recipe summary, recipe ranking, run manifest, and staged candidate baseline artifact under `output/phase1_production_rerun/`
- workflow-scoped persisted monthly drifter and forcing stores under `data/historical_validation_inputs/<workflow_mode>/...`, with `phase1_local_input_inventory.csv` exposing what is locally reusable for the rerun
- strict gate implementation for drogued-only, full-duration, continuous, non-overlapping, in-box 72 h segments
- preferred `prototype_2021` debug lane frozen from the two accepted 2021 strict-gate segments
- preserved `prototype_2016` workflow for debugging/regression
- degraded forcing continuation is available only for forcing-provider outages in appendix/legacy/experimental lanes; drifter truth and ArcGIS/observation truth remain hard requirements
- explicit read-only audit outputs under `output/phase1_finalization_audit/`
- structural separation between historical/regional validation and spill-case validation

What still remains:

- deliberate downstream trial runs only if you want to test the separate broader `2016-2022` regional/reference candidate artifact under `BASELINE_SELECTION_PATH=output/phase1_production_rerun/phase1_baseline_selection_candidate.yaml`
- explicit governance only if you later decide to replace the now-official Mindoro-focused B1 baseline with the broader regional/reference candidate
- optional read-only follow-up refreshes through `phase1_audit` and `phase5_sync`

## Phase 2

- Plain-language status: scientifically usable right now, but not scientifically frozen.
- Scientifically reportable: `true`
- Scientifically frozen: `false`
- Inherited provisional: `true`
- Biggest blocker: Phase 2 remains scientifically usable but not fully frozen because the broader upstream Phase 1 regional/reference lane is still not finalized as the completed multi-year study, and legacy recipe-family drift still exists in parts of config/runtime space.

What is already in place:

- deterministic control kept separate from the ensemble
- canonical `prob_presence`, `mask_p50`, and `mask_p90` semantics
- fixed 50-member ensemble design
- date-composite logic without silently relabeling products
- common-grid discipline and machine-readable loading audits
- read-only audit outputs under `output/phase2_finalization_audit/`

What remains provisional:

- the default Mindoro spill-case baseline file now selects `cmems_gfs`, but the broader upstream `2016-2022` regional/reference lane is still not frozen as the completed multi-year study
- legacy `*_ncep` recipe-family drift still exists in config/runtime space, even though the dedicated Phase 1 production lane now evaluates only the Chapter 3 official family
- the canonical March 13 -> March 14 R1 primary-validation rerun and its curated final-output export were refreshed to `cmems_gfs`, but some older archive/support manifests may still predate the focused Mindoro provenance promotion
- `prototype_2021` remains a debug/demo lane rather than the final Chapter 3 regional evidence base

## Legacy Prototype 2016 Support Lane

- Plain-language status: preserved legacy support lane only, reframed thesis-facing as `Phase 1 -> Phase 2 -> Phase 3A -> Phase 4 -> Phase 5`.
- Reportable: `false` as final evidence, `true` as legacy support/comparator context.
- Methodological role: this preserved three-date 2016 lane captures the earliest prototype stage of the study. The very first prototype code used the shared first-code search box `[108.6465, 121.3655, 6.1865, 20.3515]` on the west coast of the Philippines (Palawan-side western Philippine context).
- Historical-origin note: because the ingestion-and-validation pipeline was still in its early stage, that first code surfaced the first three 2016 drifter cases, and the team then intentionally kept those three as the first study focus to build the workflow and prove the pipeline was working. This historical-origin note does not replace the stored case-local prototype extents, which remain unchanged.
- Guardrail: there is no thesis-facing `Phase 3B` or `Phase 3C` for `prototype_2016`.
- Phase 3A package scope: deterministic plus support-only `p50`/`p90` OpenDrift tracks against deterministic PyGNOME.
- Comparator interpretation: the Phase 3A OpenDrift-versus-deterministic-PyGNOME check is support-only. A non-zero fraction skill score means the ensemble footprint was not completely disjoint from the deterministic PyGNOME forecast; it does not make PyGNOME truth or elevate this lane into final Chapter 3 evidence.
- Phase 4 legacy weathering scope: drifter-of-record point seeding, preserved as honesty-support/debug context rather than as official Phase 4 validation.
- Phase 4 PyGNOME pilot scope: budget-only deterministic comparator support using matched case-specific grid wind/current forcing where available; shoreline comparison is not packaged because the pilot does not emit matched shoreline-arrival or shoreline-segment outputs.
- Release-origin note: the authoritative `prototype_2016` release lat/lon/time comes from the selected drifter-of-record start in `data/drifters/CASE_2016-*/drifters_noaa.csv`. Some stored compatibility fields may still mention `data/arcgis/CASE_2016-*/source_point_metadata.geojson`, but that file is not the actual spill origin for the 2016 runs.

## Mindoro Phase 3

Promotion and provenance control:

- Frozen base case file: `config/case_mindoro_retro_2023.yaml`
- Promotion amendment file: `config/case_mindoro_retro_2023_phase3b_primary_validation_amendment.yaml`
- Canonical primary launcher entry: `mindoro_phase3b_primary_public_validation`
- Backward-compatible launcher alias: `mindoro_march13_14_noaa_reinit_stress_test`
- Shared-imagery guardrail: both NOAA/NESDIS public products cite March 12 WorldView-3 imagery, so the promoted B1 row is reportable as a reinitialization-based public-validation pair, not as an independent day-to-day validation.
- Track semantics: `B1` is the only main-text primary Mindoro validation row; `A` is the same-case comparator-support track attached to `B1`; `archive_r0` is the March 13 -> March 14 R0 archived baseline; `B2` is the March 6 archive-only sparse-reference row; `B3` is the March 3-6 archive-only broader-support row.
- Spatial semantics: focused Phase 1 validation box `[118.751, 124.305, 10.620, 16.026]`; broad `mindoro_case_domain` fallback transport/overview extent `[115.0, 122.0, 6.0, 14.5]`; current scoring-grid display bounds `[120.90964677179262, 122.0621541786303, 12.249384840763462, 13.783655303175253]`.
- Presentation note: `output/figure_package_publication/` now also carries a shared thesis study-box reference figure that foregrounds `mindoro_case_domain` plus the prototype_2016 historical-origin box, while preserving the focused Mindoro Phase 1 box and the scoring-grid display bounds as archived secondary geography references in the thesis-facing UI/package layer.

### Phase 3A Benchmark Comparator Support

- Plain-language status: validation-support comparator track built around the promoted March 13 -> March 14 reinit comparison and attached to B1 rather than standing as a co-primary row.
- Reportable: `true`
- Frozen: `false`
- Guardrail: PyGNOME is comparator-only and not truth.

### Phase 3B1 March 13 -> March 14 Primary Validation

- Plain-language status: validation-focused and reportable promoted primary row carried under the thesis-facing title `Phase 3B Observation-Based Spatial Validation Using Public Mindoro Spill Extents`, with an explicit caveat that both NOAA products cite March 12 WorldView-3 imagery.
- Reportable: `true`
- Frozen: `false`
- Provenance: the original March 3 -> March 6 base case YAML stays frozen; this promotion is authorized through the separate amendment file above.
- Recipe-provenance note: the separate `phase1_mindoro_focus_pre_spill_2016_2023` drifter rerun is now the active Mindoro-specific provenance lane; it recorded `cmems_gfs` as the historical four-recipe winner, official B1 now also uses `cmems_gfs`, and it does not replace the raw-generation history of the stored B1 bundle.
- Thesis framing: separate focused drifter-based Phase 1 provenance -> Phase 2 -> Phase 3B primary validation.
- PyGNOME role on the same case: comparator-only support evidence, not truth and not the main validation claim.
- Guardrail: present it as the canonical Mindoro validation row, but keep the shared-imagery caveat explicit and do not describe it as independent day-to-day validation.

### Phase 3B2 Legacy March 6 Sparse Reference

- Plain-language status: preserved archive-only sparse-reference provenance track.
- Reportable: `true`
- Frozen: `false`
- Guardrail: keep it repo-preserved for provenance, audit, and reproducibility, but do not present it as the canonical Mindoro result or call it primary anywhere.

### Phase 3B3 Legacy Broader Public Support

- Plain-language status: reportable archive-only broader public-validation support track.
- Reportable: `true`
- Frozen: `false`
- Guardrail: keep it separate from both the promoted March 13 -> March 14 primary row and from DWH transfer validation, and surface it through archive/provenance handling rather than through the main thesis-facing Mindoro page.

## DWH Phase 3C

- Plain-language status: frozen validation-only external rich-data transfer case.
- Thesis framing: separate external transfer-validation/support case; Mindoro remains the main Philippine thesis case.
- C-track semantics: `C1` deterministic external transfer validation, `C2` ensemble extension and deterministic-vs-ensemble comparison, `C3` PyGNOME comparator-only.
- Deterministic OpenDrift: reportable transfer-validation result and the clean baseline DWH result.
- Ensemble comparison: reportable transfer-validation support/comparative result; p50 is the preferred probabilistic extension and p90 remains support/comparison only.
- PyGNOME comparator: reportable comparator-only result and never truth.
- Frozen: `true`
- Inherited provisional: `false`
- Guardrail: DWH observed masks remain truth, and PyGNOME remains comparator-only.
- No new drifter ingestion: thesis-facing DWH packaging does not ingest new drifter data and does not reopen Phase 1-style recipe competition.
- Forcing-stack selection rule: readiness-gated historical stack, not Phase 1 drifter-selected baseline logic.
- Current frozen DWH stack: HYCOM GOFS 3.1 currents + ERA5 winds + CMEMS wave/Stokes.
- Date-composite truth rule: use the 2010-05-20 initialization composite plus the 2010-05-21, 2010-05-22, and 2010-05-23 validation composites honestly as date labels only; do not invent exact sub-daily observation acquisition times.
- Forcing-outage policy: strict/reportable by default. Use `FORCING_OUTAGE_POLICY=continue_degraded` only if you intentionally want a provisional readiness result after a temporary forcing-provider outage.
- Scientific-ready means: not smoke-only, full May 20-23, 2010 coverage, required variables and usable metadata present, OpenDrift reader exposes the required variables, and the assembled stack completes a small reader-check forecast.
- Drop-in methods note: `docs/DWH_METHODS_NOTE.md`
- Final governance note: `docs/DWH_PHASE3C_FINAL.md`
- Freeze sync note: `docs/DWH_PHASE3C_FREEZE_SYNC_NOTE.md`

## Phase 4 Support Layer

- Plain-language status: implemented Mindoro oil-type and shoreline support bundle outside the main thesis phase count; thesis-facing `Phase 4` language is reserved for `prototype_2016`.
- Scientifically reportable: `true` as a technical/support bundle, `false` as a main thesis phase outside `prototype_2016`
- Scientifically frozen: `false`
- Inherited provisional: `true`
- Does this support bundle still depend on a later full Phase 1 production rerun for the final frozen baseline story? `no`, but it still depends on a manual downstream trial or promotion step if you want the new candidate baseline to become the default.
- Is any part of official product generation still coupled to legacy recipe naming drift? `yes`
- Biggest remaining blocker: the new Phase 1 candidate baseline is staged, but official spill-case workflows still use the older canonical baseline file unless you promote or override it manually with `BASELINE_SELECTION_PATH` or an explicit promotion step.

What is already in place:

- dedicated `phase4_oiltype_and_shoreline` workflow
- stable scenario registry in `config/phase4_oil_scenarios.csv`
- shoreline arrival timing, shoreline segments, oil budgets, and oil-type comparison outputs under `output/phase4/CASE_MINDORO_RETRO_2023/`
- explicit provenance fields recording baseline source, transport provenance, and inherited provisional status

What remains provisional:

- upstream Phase 1 freeze remains incomplete
- Phase 2 remains scientifically usable but not frozen
- legacy recipe-family drift is only documented and guarded, not fully removed
- `fixed_base_medium_heavy_proxy` remains flagged for mass-balance follow-up
- DWH Phase 4 remains deferred

## Phase 4 Cross-Model Comparability Audit

- Plain-language status: no matched Mindoro Phase 4 PyGNOME comparison is packaged yet; no scientifically defensible Phase 4 OpenDrift-versus-PyGNOME comparison is available from the current stored outputs.
- Scientifically reportable: `false`
- Reportable now: `true` for the audit verdict itself, `false` for a Phase 4 cross-model result
- Scientifically frozen: `false`
- Inherited provisional: `true`
- Biggest blocker: the repo still lacks a matched Mindoro PyGNOME Phase 4 output family with the same scenario registry, weathering compartments, and shoreline-segment semantics used by OpenDrift Phase 4.

What is already in place:

- `output/phase4/CASE_MINDORO_RETRO_2023/` contains real OpenDrift Phase 4 oil-budget, shoreline-arrival, and shoreline-segment outputs
- Mindoro and DWH PyGNOME Phase 3 comparator tracks already exist as spatial transport comparators
- helper code exists for parsing PyGNOME mass budgets and plotting OpenOil-versus-PyGNOME overlays
- explicit read-only audit outputs now live under `output/phase4_crossmodel_comparability_audit/`
- final decision note: `docs/PHASE4_COMPARATOR_DECISION.md`

Why no matched PyGNOME Phase 4 package is published yet:

- Mindoro PyGNOME benchmark metadata explicitly records `weathering_enabled=false`
- current stored PyGNOME NetCDF diagnostics collapse to 100% surface and 0% evaporated/dispersed/beached, which is not a defensible Phase 4 fate comparator
- no stored PyGNOME shoreline-arrival or shoreline-segment output family exists
- DWH PyGNOME remains a Phase 3 comparator branch and does not substitute for a matched Mindoro Phase 4 run

## Phase 5 Support Layer

- Plain-language status: read-only launcher/docs/package synchronization and explorer support layer outside the main thesis phase count; thesis-facing `Phase 5` language is reserved for `prototype_2016`.
- Scientifically reportable: `false`
- Reportable now: `true`
- Scientifically frozen: `false`
- Inherited provisional: `false`
- Scope: non-scientific reproducibility, launcher, documentation, and packaging sync built from existing artifacts without recomputing science.

What is already in place:

- matrix-driven launcher via `config/launcher_matrix.json` and `start.ps1`
- `output/final_reproducibility_package/` with software, case, config, manifest, log, output, and phase-status indexes
- synchronized documentation for launcher safety, command matrix, and current phase boundaries
- `output/trajectory_gallery/` with a static technical figure manifest, index, and trajectory/overlay/Phase 4 support figures built from existing artifacts only
- `output/trajectory_gallery_panel/` with polished comparison boards, captions, talking points, and panel recommendations built from the existing gallery and stored outputs only
- `output/figure_package_publication/` with canonical publication-grade single figures, side-by-side boards, captions, and defense talking points built from existing outputs only
- `output/2016 Legacy Runs FINAL Figures/` with a curated prototype_2016 paper-facing figure set, per-case subfolders, `final_figure_manifest.json`, and `missing_figures.csv` built from existing legacy outputs only
- `ui/` read-only dashboard pages that consume the publication package first, then expose panel/raw/archive artifacts only when advanced mode is enabled

Optional future work still deferred:

- interactive UI run controls
- deeper artifact filtering inside the UI
- DWH Phase 4 appendix pilot

## Read-Only Dashboard

- Plain-language status: implemented read-only local support/exploration layer for the current packaged outputs.
- Scientifically reportable: `false`
- Reportable now: `true`
- Scientifically frozen: `false`
- Inherited provisional: `true`
- Scope: non-scientific dashboard over publication figures, panel/raw archives, final reproducibility indexes, and the Phase 4 cross-model audit.

What is already in place:

- panel-friendly mode that defaults to publication-grade figures and recommended defense boards
- advanced mode that exposes panel/raw figures, manifests, logs, and lower-level artifact inspection
- dedicated pages for Mindoro validation, the Mindoro validation archive, DWH transfer validation, cross-model comparison, Phase 4 support/context interpretation, and Phase 4 cross-model deferred status
- an explicit read-only Phase 4 cross-model status page that states the comparison is deferred and links to blocker/next-step artifacts

What remains deferred:

- scientific rerun controls from the UI
- deeper in-app artifact search/filtering beyond the current page-level controls

## Trajectory Gallery

- Plain-language status: implemented read-only technical figure layer for panel inspection.
- Scientifically reportable: `false`
- Reportable now: `true`
- Scientifically frozen: `false`
- Inherited provisional: `true`
- Scope: static trajectories, overlays, comparison maps, and Mindoro Phase 4 support/context shoreline/oil-type figures built from existing outputs without rerunning science.

Panel-ready now:

- Mindoro deterministic path figure
- Mindoro sampled ensemble member trajectory summary
- Mindoro centroid/corridor/hull view
- Mindoro March 13 -> March 14 primary-validation overlays
- Mindoro March 13 -> March 14 cross-model comparison maps
- DWH deterministic path figure
- DWH ensemble p50/p90 overlays
- DWH OpenDrift vs PyGNOME comparison maps
- Mindoro Phase 4 oil-budget figures
- Mindoro Phase 4 shoreline-arrival and shoreline-segment figures

Still optional future work:

- deeper interactive filtering/search around the gallery inside the UI
- interactive trajectory filtering/search

## Trajectory Gallery Panel Pack

- Plain-language status: implemented read-only polished board layer for panel presentation.
- Scientifically reportable: `false`
- Reportable now: `true`
- Scientifically frozen: `false`
- Inherited provisional: `true`
- Scope: panel-ready trajectory, comparison, and support/context Phase 4 boards with captions and talking points built from the raw gallery and stored outputs only.

Recommended main-presentation boards:

- Mindoro March 13 -> March 14 primary validation board
- Mindoro March 13 -> March 14 cross-model comparator board
- Mindoro trajectory board
- DWH deterministic forecast-vs-observation board
- DWH deterministic vs ensemble board
- DWH OpenDrift vs PyGNOME comparison board

Optional support/context boards:

- Mindoro Phase 4 oil-budget board
- Mindoro Phase 4 shoreline-arrival / shoreline-impact board

Still optional future work:

- alternate print-layout variants for every board
- deeper interactive board filtering/search inside the UI

## Publication Figure Package

- Plain-language status: implemented canonical publication-grade presentation layer.
- Scientifically reportable: `false`
- Reportable now: `true`
- Scientifically frozen: `false`
- Inherited provisional: `true`
- Scope: publication-grade single figures, side-by-side boards, captions, talking points, and a Phase 4 deferred-comparison note figure built from existing outputs without rerunning science.

Recommended main-presentation figures:

- Mindoro March 13 -> March 14 primary validation board
- Mindoro March 13 -> March 14 cross-model comparator board
- Mindoro trajectory publication board
- DWH deterministic forecast-vs-observation board
- DWH deterministic versus ensemble publication board
- DWH OpenDrift versus PyGNOME publication board

Optional support/context figures:

- Mindoro Phase 4 oil-budget publication board
- Mindoro Phase 4 shoreline-impact publication board
- Mindoro Phase 4 deferred-comparison note figure when the panel asks why no Phase 4 PyGNOME board is shown

What this package adds beyond the panel gallery:

- paper-ready single-image figures
- forced locator, zoom, and close-up variants where the observed target is tiny
- explicit publication registry, captions, and talking points
- a canonical presentation layer while keeping the raw and panel galleries as archives

What remains provisional:

- Mindoro publication figures still inherit the unfinished Phase 1/2 frozen-baseline story
- legacy recipe-family drift remains upstream and is documented rather than fully removed
- DWH publication figures remain transfer-validation/support visuals, not a replacement for the Mindoro thesis case
