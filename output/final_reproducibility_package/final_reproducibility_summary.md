# Final Reproducibility Summary

This package synchronizes launcher/menu behavior, documentation, and reproducibility indexes around the current local repo state without rerunning the expensive scientific branches by default.

## Launcher Entrypoint

- PowerShell entrypoint: `./start.ps1 -List -NoPause`
- Source-of-truth launcher matrix: `config/launcher_matrix.json`
- Safe read-only launcher IDs: `mindoro_march6_recovery_sensitivity`, `phase1_audit`, `phase2_audit`, `b1_drifter_context_panel`, `final_validation_package`, `phase5_sync`, `trajectory_gallery`, `trajectory_gallery_panel`, `figure_package_publication`, `prototype_legacy_final_figures`

## Phase Status Highlights

- `phase1` / `phase1_regional_baseline`: Architecture audited; the final 2016-2022 production rerun is still needed.
- `phase2` / `phase2_machine_readable_forecast`: Scientifically usable as implemented, but not yet frozen.
- `phase3a` / `A`: Same-case Track A comparator-only support attached to the March 13 -> March 14 R1 primary validation row. fss_1km=0.0000, fss_3km=0.0441, fss_5km=0.1371, fss_10km=0.2490
- `phase3b` / `B1`: March 13 -> March 14 R1 primary validation row only; the focused 2016-2023 Mindoro drifter rerun found cmems_gfs as the historical winner, official B1 now uses cmems_gfs, and the stored promoted run remains tied to the existing R1_previous reinit lineage. fss_1km=0.0000, fss_3km=0.0441, fss_5km=0.1371, fss_10km=0.2490
- `phase3b` / `B2`: B2 archived March 6 sparse reference; preserved for provenance only and not thesis-facing. fss_1km=0.0000, fss_3km=0.0000, fss_5km=0.0000, fss_10km=0.0000
- `phase3b` / `B3`: B3 archived March 3-6 broader-support reference; preserved for provenance only. fss_1km=0.1722, fss_3km=0.2004, fss_5km=0.2166, fss_10km=0.2438
- `phase3c` / `C1`: Frozen DWH deterministic transfer-validation baseline. fss_1km=0.5033, fss_3km=0.5523, fss_5km=0.5700, fss_10km=0.6018
- `phase3c` / `C2`: Frozen DWH ensemble extension on the same truth masks; p50 preferred, p90 support-only. fss_1km=0.4997, fss_3km=0.5299, fss_5km=0.5467, fss_10km=0.5790
- `phase3c` / `C3`: Frozen DWH cross-model comparator; PyGNOME not truth. fss_1km=0.3197, fss_3km=0.3495, fss_5km=0.3689, fss_10km=0.4068
- `phase4` / `mindoro_phase4`: Phase 4 OpenDrift/OpenOil-only interpretation; inherited-provisional.
- `phase5` / `phase5_sync`: Launcher, docs, and reproducibility packaging are synchronized around the current repo state without rerunning expensive science.
- `phase5` / `phase5_read_only_dashboard`: The local dashboard is now available as a read-only Phase 5 exploration layer built on the current packaging outputs and publication-grade figures.

## Packaging Sync Scope

- Existing scientific Mindoro and DWH outputs were reused and not recomputed here.
- The existing `output/final_validation_package/` bundle was reused rather than rebuilt from scratch.
- Mindoro keeps the frozen base case definition in `config/case_mindoro_retro_2023.yaml` and records the promoted March 13 -> March 14 Phase 3B primary row through the separate `config/case_mindoro_retro_2023_phase3b_primary_validation_amendment.yaml` amendment file.
- The thesis-facing B1 title is `Phase 3B Observation-Based Spatial Validation Using Public Mindoro Spill Extents`, and the separate focused 2016-2023 Mindoro drifter rerun now promotes the focused winner `cmems_gfs` without rewriting the stored B1 raw provenance.
- The curated read-only B1 export now lives under `output/Phase 3B March13-14 Final Output` and packages the publication figures, canonical scientific source PNGs, summary CSV, decision note, and local manifest.
- The curated read-only DWH export now lives under `output/Phase 3C DWH Final Output` and packages the Phase 3C observation context figures, deterministic baseline figures, ensemble extension figures, PyGNOME comparator figures, canonical scientific source PNGs, and summary/manifests without rerunning science.
- `prototype_2016` is cataloged here as a legacy Phase 1 / 2 / 3A / 4 / 5 support lane, with the dedicated curated package rooted at `output/2016 Legacy Runs FINAL Figures` and repo-wide `phase5_sync` kept as a separate cross-repo reproducibility layer.
- Its historical-origin note keeps the shared first-code search box `[108.6465, 121.3655, 6.1865, 20.3515]` explicit for the first three 2016 drifters on the west coast of the Philippines, while the stored per-case local prototype extents remain operative.
- Mindoro Phase 4 now participates in the reproducibility/package layer via the current `phase4_run_manifest.json` and verdict bundle.
- The static `output/trajectory_gallery/` bundle now participates in the reproducibility/package layer as a read-only technical figure set.
- The static `output/trajectory_gallery_panel/` bundle now participates in the reproducibility/package layer as the polished panel-ready figure pack.
- The static `output/figure_package_publication/` bundle now participates in the reproducibility/package layer as the canonical publication-grade presentation package.
- The new `ui/` layer now participates as a read-only local dashboard over the existing packaged outputs and figures rather than as a rerun control surface.
