# Prototype 2016 Legacy Final Package

This folder is the authoritative curated `prototype_2016` legacy support export. It is thesis-facing only as a legacy support package and does not replace the final regional Phase 1 study.

## What This Package Means

- `prototype_2016` is legacy support-only.
- The visible legacy support flow here is `Phase 1 -> Phase 2 -> Phase 3A -> Phase 4 -> Phase 5`.
- `Phase 3A` is comparator-only OpenDrift vs deterministic PyGNOME support.
- `Phase 4` is the legacy weathering/fate family seeded from the selected drifter-of-record start.
- A limited deterministic `Phase 4` PyGNOME budget comparator pilot may also be packaged when stored case-local comparator outputs exist; shoreline comparison remains unavailable unless matched PyGNOME shoreline products are present.
- `Phase 5` is this read-only packaging/export layer built from stored outputs.
- There is no thesis-facing `Phase 3B` or `Phase 3C` in this lane.
- This lane does not replace the final regional Phase 1 study.

## Folder Guide

- `publication/phase3a/`: legacy Phase 3A support figures copied from the stored publication/similarity outputs.
- `publication/phase4/`: legacy Phase 4 weathering/fate publication figures plus shoreline summary figures derived from stored shoreline CSVs only.
- `publication/phase4_comparator/`: budget-only deterministic PyGNOME Phase 4 comparator pilot figures when available.
- `scientific_source_pngs/phase3a/`: exact stored Phase 3A source PNGs.
- `scientific_source_pngs/phase4/`: exact stored Phase 4 source PNGs.
- `scientific_source_pngs/phase4_comparator/`: exact stored Phase 4 PyGNOME comparator PNGs when available.
- `summary/phase3a/`: similarity/FSS/KL tables, per-case pairing artifacts, and source-path notes.
- `summary/phase4/`: copied budget/shoreline CSVs plus a lightweight phase4 registry.
- `summary/phase4_comparator/`: copied deterministic PyGNOME budget-comparator tables plus the decision note describing why shoreline comparison is still unavailable.
- `manifests/`: machine-readable registries for this curated export.
- `phase5/`: packaging notes describing what was copied vs regenerated.

## Compatibility Note

The flat per-case PNG directories at this root (`CASE_2016-09-01/`, `CASE_2016-09-06/`, `CASE_2016-09-17/`) are preserved for backward compatibility. The structured subfolders above are the easier-to-browse authoritative package layout.
