# Final Validation Methodology Amendment Memo

## 1. Amendment Summary

This amendment will update the thesis-facing methodology language so it matches the current repository state without blurring provenance. The central reporting change will be that the March 13 -> March 14 R1 primary validation row will be the only thesis-facing Mindoro Phase 3B validation row used in the main paper. That decision will not delete or rewrite the original March 3 -> March 6 case definition. Instead, the frozen base-case YAML will remain the preserved historical case-definition artifact, while the promoted March 13 -> March 14 R1 row will be carried through the separate amendment path and reported as the main validation result with an explicit shared-imagery caveat.

## 2. What Will Change In Reporting And What Will Not Change In Frozen Artifacts

What will change is the reporting priority. The thesis will foreground only the March 13 -> March 14 R1 primary validation row, will keep Track A as the same-case cross-model comparator support lane, and will move the March 13 -> March 14 R0 archived baseline plus the preserved March-family legacy rows to archive-only provenance handling. What will not change is the stored scientific provenance: the original March 3 -> March 6 case-definition file will remain frozen, the March 13 -> March 14 R0 baseline and the B2/B3 rows will remain repo-preserved, and the repo will not pretend that the newer reporting emphasis came from silently rewriting older artifacts.

The same principle applies upstream. Phase 1 will remain defended as a 2016-2022 historical and regional transport-calibration window using the fixed validation box and strict drifter-selection logic. The 2021 cases will remain support or demonstration context only. They help interpret the workflow, but they do not replace the dedicated regional rerun as the official Phase 1 evidence base. If the staged candidate baseline has not yet been deliberately promoted into the official default spill-case path, then Phase 2 and downstream spill-case defaults will remain scientifically usable but still inherit a provisional freeze status.

## 3. Evidence-Role Guardrails

The methodology will keep the repo's evidence tracks separated. Drifters will serve as Phase 1 transport-calibration evidence on the historical/regional corpus. Observed spill masks will serve as the scored truth/reference layer for spill-case validation. PyGNOME will remain comparator-only in cross-model discussions and must not be presented as truth. DWH will remain a separate external transfer-validation case that supports transferability claims without replacing Mindoro as the main Philippine case. Prototype lanes will remain support, demo, or regression material only and must not be upgraded into final thesis evidence.

The same separation applies spatially. The regional transport-validation box is the calibration and audit domain for the historical corpus, while the Mindoro spill scoring domain is the event-specific scoring frame for the observed spill geometry. These are complementary domains with different methodological jobs, not competing definitions of the same study area.

## 4. Limitations And Freeze-Status Honesty

Two limitations should remain explicit in the thesis text. First, the promoted March 13 -> March 14 R1 primary validation row is not a fully independent day-to-day satellite validation because both NOAA/NESDIS public products cite March 12 WorldView-3 imagery. It should therefore be described as a promoted reinitialization-based public-validation pair with shared-imagery provenance. Second, the workflow remains upstream-provisional if the candidate Phase 1 historical/regional baseline has not yet been manually promoted into the official default baseline configuration. Under that condition, Phase 2 and downstream spill-case products remain scientifically usable and reportable, but the thesis should not claim that the baseline freeze story is already complete.

## 5. Archive-Only Mindoro Rule

The March 13 -> March 14 R0 baseline, any already-generated older March13-14 outputs that included R0, and the preserved March-family legacy rows will remain in the repository for archival provenance and reproducibility only. They will not be used in the thesis-facing methodology, tables, figures, or headline validation claims. The `Mindoro Validation Archive` page will remain provenance-only and will not serve as the main Mindoro validation evidence surface.

## 6. Naming Note

In methodology-facing wording, `March 13 -> March 14 R1` and `March 13 -> March 14 R0` will refer to Phase 3B validation branches. They will not be used as shorthand for the separate Phase 1 Recipe Code family (`R1`, `R2`, `R3`, `R4`).
